# These People Do Not Exist

### AI that generates human faces which have never been seen before.

The composite model has a generator that maps all points from a prior distribution to brand new data, and a discriminator that tells to which extent this data is similar to the original data, both training in parallel, with each model aiming to minimize it's own loss and maximize the other model's loss.

The images the model was trained on and the ones the AI generates are low resolution - this may make them look a little blurry. Train longer for better results. 

Below are some of the faces the AI created, which look plausible.
