<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a very basic unofficial implementation of the research paper ["A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948) published by NVIDIA in 2018. [Here is the official implementation.](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan)

### Techniques implemented from the paper

- Mapping the latent vector to an intermediate latent vector
- Use of bilinear upsampling with normal convolutions over transpose convolutions
- Adaptive Instance Normalization
- Constant generator input
- Application of the latent vector to each block in the generator
- Addition of noise to each block in the generator
- Gradient penalty loss
- Mixing regularization

### Training

The dataset used was the CelebaHQ dataset, scaled to 256x256 pixels.

Below are samples generated after 230000 iterations of training with a batch size of 12, a channel coefficient of 48, and a base learning rate of 1e-4.

Training on a Tesla P100 GPU using the above configuration will take approximately 24 hours.

### Style Mixing
=======
The composite model has a generator that maps all points from a prior distribution to brand new data, and a discriminator that tells to which extent this data is similar to the original data, both training in parallel, with each model aiming to minimize it's own loss and maximize the other model's loss.

The images the model was trained on and the ones the AI generates are low resolution - this may make them look a little blurry. Train longer for better results.

The following images were generated by mixing coarse styles (pose, gender, smile) from images on the left column with fine styles (skin color, hair color, etc) from images on the top row.
